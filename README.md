# Linux Labs

This repository documents my structured Linux practice while building system-level confidence for Cloud and Security engineering.

The goal is to develop strong command-line proficiency, understand how Linux systems operate, and apply practical automation through scripting.

---

## Current Stage

Initial environment setup:
- Ubuntu Server (VM / WSL)
- Basic shell navigation practice

More labs and scripts will be added progressively as topics are explored.

---

## Focus Areas

- File system navigation
- Permissions and ownership
- Processes and services
- Networking fundamentals
- Bash scripting basics

## Purpose

Linux is a foundational skill for Cloud Architecture and Security roles.
This repository serves as a hands-on lab journal and technical practice space.
